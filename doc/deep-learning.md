simple neural network
---

input connect to hidden layer and hidden layer connect to output.
full connect to next layer.


supervised learning: which have input and output.

structured data: a table of data, eg. database.
unstructured data: video image text etc.

performance by datasize:
 logistic regession: grow up and become vertical.
 small NN: grow up and become vertical but more heigher.
 large NN: grow up and up to more heigher.
 
more data and complex model are both required.
in small datasize many alrgothem are samier.

switch sigmoid function to ReLU function is more faster.

idea-code-test loop faster is better.
